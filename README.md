# 👋 Hi, I’m Clément Oliva — aka @Coleim

🎮 Developer. Architect. Advocate. Storyteller.

I’m a senior fullstack developer and frontend architect working in Developer Relations at Amadeus. I love building elegant frontend systems, scaling dev experience across teams, and exploring the intersection between code, creativity, and teaching.

📺 I also run a 100% tech YouTube channel where I share insights, experiments, and dev tools:

*I build tools, games, and experiments that make dev work more engaging—and sometimes weirdly fun.*

## 🛠️ Completed Side Projects

Here are some of the small tools and experiments I've built recently. They're live, fun to play with, and always open to feedback!

### 🎹 [Sound of Math](https://sound-of-math.onrender.com/)
A playful visualization that turns math equations into sound waves.

> *Built with React and the Web Audio API.*

### ⌨️ [Online Code Typewriter](https://online-code-typewriter.onrender.com/)
Type code that appears one character at a time for tutorials, live demos.
